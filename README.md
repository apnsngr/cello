Cello Jekyll Theme

Overview
--------

`Cello` is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme, which uses the
[Basscss](http://www.basscss.com) toolkit for styling and solarized light for
code snippents.

Branching
---------

This repository uses the
[Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching
model. A handy git extension for Gitflow is available
[here](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). However, I am currently not using it,
since the current version (0.4.1) tags the release branch instead of the master
branch.
